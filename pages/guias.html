                10 Linux Tools to Know as Sysadmin
            </h1>
        </div>
        <p class="text-center">Sooner or later, all system administrators face the challenge of administering servers.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md-start">Tools come to rescue the sysadmin’s life.

            As a sysadmin, you just don’t work on core OS (Linux or Windows) but also deals with what is hosted on them.
            It could be a database, application server, web server, messaging applications, caching, etc. The following
            tools should help you in many ways.</p>
         <h2 class="guides">Zenmap</h2>
        <p class="text-md-center"> When you need to discover network-related issues, Zenmap will come to the rescue. It
            is not a tool you’ll use daily to administer your system, but it will prove to be invaluable when the need
            to scan the network to troubleshoot issues arises.

            It is a front end for the Nmap network scanner that not only runs on Linux but also in Windows, BSD, other
            versions of Unix, and macOS. Besides network scanning, Zenmap can be used for penetration testing and port
            scanning, either by experienced or beginner sysadmins.</p>
         <img class="guides" src="../images/zenmap.web" alt="">
        <p class="text-md-center"> Zenmap can store profiles, which certainly is one of its strengths. These profiles
            can be reused for later
            scans.</p>
         <h2 class="guides">Webmin</h2>
        <p class="text-md-center">This one-stop-shop tool offers a web-based interface for administering every aspect of
            a Linux server. From
            file sharing to DNS, to Apache web server and various databases. If you need something that is not included
            in the default package, you can pick one from a huge catalog of third-party modules that bring added
            functionality.</p>
         <img class="guides" src="../images/Webmin.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="text-md-center">You just have to download the latest version and copy it to the server’s home folder.
            After that, you simply
            run the command: dpkg -i webmin_(version).deb. And that’s all.</p>
         <h2 class="guides"> Cockpit</h2>
        <p class="text-md-start">Cockpit is another server administration tool. It stands out for being
            “beginner-friendly”: it is easy to use, lightweight and simple, yet very powerful. It offers a web-based GUI
            that facilitates storage admin tasks, service starting/stopping, journal inspection, and multi-server setup
            management.

            The tool was created for Red Hat, but it runs on many Linux server distributions, besides Red Hat Enterprise
            Linux (RHEL): Fedora, Arch Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, among others.</p>
         <img class="guides" src="../images/cockpit-project.webp" alt="">
        <p class="text-md-center">The installation procedure varies for each distribution. In some distributions, like
            Fedora, CentOS and RHEL, Cockpit can be found in the official repositories. In others, like Debian, Ubuntu,
            and Linux Mint, you can install Cockpit from its official PPA.</p>

         <h2 class="guides">GPing</h2>
        <p class="text-md-center">A fantastic graph-based PING utility. The great thing is, gping lets you visualize
            multiple endpoints ping in a real-time graph.</p>
         <img class="guides" src="../images/gping.webp" alt="">
        <p class="text-md-center">This can be a great choice when you have to compare the ping latency for two or more
            URLs. You can ping IPv4 or IPv6 address and the installer are available for Ubuntu, CentOS, macOS, and
            Windows.</p>
         <h2 class="guides">ShoreWall</h2>
        <p class="text-md-center">This tool adds an abstraction layer for achieving a higher-level configuration of
            Netfilter. Shorewall reads configuration files and configures Netfilter in the Linux kernel, with the
            support of the ip, tc, iptables, and iptables-restore utilities. The advantage of using Shorewall is that it
            divides the interfaces into zones, assigning different levels of access to each one.</p>
         <img class="guides" src="../images/Shorewall.webp" alt="">
        <p class="text-md-center">It allows the user to operate on groups of computers connected to the interface,
            instead of working on groups of addresses. Users can easily deploy different policies for each zone.</p>
         <h2 class="guides">Nagios</h2>
        <p class="text-md-center">This open-source network monitoring tool was launched in 2002 under the name NetSaint.
            Since then, Nagios has gone a long way, awarding itself a strong reputation for doing a great job monitoring
            servers and network devices. It works well out of the box when it is given the task to monitor an
            environment with many basic protocols. Nagios also provides a base for other monitoring utilities, such as
            Naemon, Icinga, and OP5.</p>
         <img class="guides" src="../images/Nagios.webp" alt="">
        <p class="text-md-center">
            Nagios got great documentation for you to get it started.
        </p>
         <h2 class="guides">phpMyAdmin</h2>
        <p class="text-md-center">For those who also have to deal with database maintenance, phpMyAdmin is a classic and
            very popular tool. The main reason for its popularity is perhaps its portability. phpMyAdmin runs in a web
            browser, which means you can use it from any device, even from a smartphone. Another reason is that it
            covers all the necessary functions required to manage the database, and you practically don’t have to know
            how to write queries in SQL to do that.</p>
         <img class="guides" src="../images/phpMyAdmin.webp" alt="">
         <h2 class="guides">Puppet</h2>
        <p class="text-md-center">To manage the growing number of servers that run on a corporate network, as a Linux
            admin, you will need the best-of-breed tools to do orchestration and configuration management. One of these
            tools is Puppet, a complete one when you take into account user interfaces, modules and available actions.
        </p>
         <img class="guides" src="../images/Puppet.webp" alt="">
        <p class="text-md-center">Puppet not only shows you the whole picture of the Linux server ecosystem but also
            includes almost any other operating system that may be operating in the network, giving you a deep insight
            into each one. Installation is easy.</p>
         <h2 class="guides">Mysql WorkBench</h2>
        <p class="text-md-center">For those of you who need to manage MySQL databases but don’t like web-based GUIs,
            feeling more comfortable with traditional windowed apps, then MySQL Workbench is your tool. The bright side
            of this app is that it installs very simple and has an easy to use graphical interface, grouping every MySQL
            task you may need to perform.</p>
         <img class="guides" src="../images/MySQL-Workbench.webp" alt="">
        <p class="text-md-center">It offers some interesting goodies, such as unlimited undo/redo, multiple MySQL
            connections and visual modeling of data and schema. It can also be automated through scripting and extended
            via plugins. The only drawback of MySQL Workbench is that, unlike phpMyAdmin, to master it you need deep
            knowledge of SQL.</p>
         <h2 class="guides">Nmap</h2>
        <p class="text-md-center">Network administrators have many options when they need to choose a monitoring tool
            capable of doing network mapping and port scanning. Among them, the de facto standard is Nmap, due to its
            combination of usability and versatility. Network admins use it for network discovery and vulnerability
            detection. It can scan all available hosts in the network, making a list of all the services they provide.

            In this way, the administrator can find open ports and take appropriate measures to reduce security risks.
